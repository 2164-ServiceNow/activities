# Project 0: SPA with Public API Integration

**Project Goal:** Develop a Single Page Application (SPA) using AngularJS that interacts with at least one publicly available, *free* API.

**Project Structure:** Pair Programming

**Overview:**

You and your partner will design, plan, propose, and implement a website of your choosing. This website *must* interact with at least one free API (some may require sign-up, but *never* require payment).

**Deadlines:**
- Monday 1/13/25 2 PM EST/12:30 AM IST: Proposal with README completed
- Friday 1/17/25 - 1-on-1 Project Check-ins
- Friday 1/24/25 - Project Presentations. See [Presentation Requirements](#presentation-requirements)


**Example Project Ideas (Non-Exhaustive):**

Feel free to look at existing websites for inspirations and spend time discussing a few options with your partner before you begin the proposal.

1.  **Movie Information Hub:** Uses the OMDb API (or similar) to search for movies, display details (poster, plot, actors, ratings), and potentially allow users to create watchlists.
2.  **Weather Dashboard:** Integrates with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to display current weather conditions, forecasts, and potentially historical data for different locations.
3.  **Public Transportation Tracker:** Uses a real-time transit API (if available for your region) to show bus/train/subway arrival times, routes, and station information.
4.  **Recipe Finder:** Uses a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) to search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, or dietary restrictions, and display instructions and nutritional information.

**README Template (Submitted *Before* Project Execution):**

```markdown
# Project Title: [Project Name]

**Project Description:** A concise explanation of the application's purpose and functionality.

**Technologies Used:**

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
*   AngularJS (Specify Version)
*   [List all other technologies used, including specific API names and links to official API documentation]

**User Stories:** (8 Total - 4 Per Developer)

1.  [User Story 1]
2.  [User Story 2]
3.  [User Story 3]
4.  [User Story 4]
5.  [User Story 5]
6.  [User Story 6]
7.  [User Story 7]
8.  [User Story 8]

**Development Environment Setup:**

*   Detailed instructions for setting up the development environment (e.g., Node.js version, npm/yarn commands, AngularJS CLI commands if applicable).
*   Precise steps to install all project dependencies.

**Collaborators:**

*   [Developer 1 Name] - GitHub Username: [GitHub Username]
*   [Developer 2 Name] - GitHub Username: [GitHub Username]
```

**User Stories Example (Movie Information Hub - 4 per developer):** (Same as before, no changes needed)

### **Requirements:**

*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** All user stories *must* be fully implemented and functional with minimal to no bugs during the demo for full credit.
    *   **Focus on Core Functionality:** Prioritize core features. Avoid overly complex or unnecessary features.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API requests and display user-friendly messages.
*   **Clear API Understanding:** Demonstrate a clear understanding of the API documentation and its usage.
*   **Code Quality:** Maintain clean, well-commented, and consistently formatted code.
*   **Pair Programming:**
    *   *At least two user stories* must be explicitly developed using pair programming. Clearly mark these stories in your commit messages (e.g., "Pair Programming: Implemented search functionality").
    *   Follow the Driver/Navigator model: One person (Driver) writes the code as instructed by the other (Navigator). Roles must switch regularly to ensure both partners experience both roles.
    *   Document pair programming sessions with clear commit messages.
*   **Version Control (Git):**
    *   Create a GitHub repository named `partner1Lastname-partner2Lastname-projectTitle`.
    *   Commit and push code *daily*.
    *   Implement a branching strategy (e.g., `main` and `dev`).
    *   *Recommended:* Merge code from working branches at least weekly (more frequent merges are strongly encouraged to minimize merge conflicts).
    *   *Recommended:* Implement a code freeze 24 hours prior to the presentation to prevent last-minute issues.

### **Presentation Requirements:**

1.  Both partners must present equally, with cameras on, in business professional attire. Presentations will be recorded.
2.  Presentations are limited to 10 minutes maximum (*strict time limit*). Question and answer time is *separate* from the 10-minute presentation.
3.  Presentations *must* include a slide deck covering:
    *   Project Overview
    *   Developer Introductions
    *   Technologies Used (including API names and brief overviews)
    *   Git Workflow and Branching Strategies
    *   Live demo of the website, showcasing *each* completed user story.
    *   Outstanding defects or known issues (if any).
    *   Challenges faced during development.
4.  A short Q&A session will follow each presentation, with priority given to fellow students for bonus credit opportunities.
